# 3-Armed Bandits Simulation

run the bandit_simulation.py script to have an interactive experience as you compete with a model operating on a basic reinforcement learning algorithm that specifically tackles the k-bandits problem. Note that this is just a prototype and does not have a UI implemented. Alternatively, to have a more interactive or immersive experience, please run the bandit_simulation_UI.py script and then write streamlit run bandit_simulation_UI.py and press enter. A UI will pop up in another tab of your browser, allowing you to play the game. 

The 3-armed bandit problem manifests here as 3 machine slots or reward generators with probability distributions initially starting off as a normal distribution with mean = 5 and std_dev = 1.5. However, the probability distributions of all generators are subject to change and may change each round (the mean may shift to the right). You compete with a model that uses a simple RL algorithm in an attempt to maximize its rewards. The machines are numbered 1-3 and you pick 1 to receive a reward from each round and likewise the model will also pick 1. You can alternatively enter Q or q to quit the game (for the prototype version).
